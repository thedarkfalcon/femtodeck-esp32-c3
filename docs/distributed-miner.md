# Distributed Miner

Distributed Miner is Femto OS's ESP-NOW cluster mining mode. One screened Femto Deck acts as the master, connects to WiFi and the mining pool, then assigns nonce ranges to nearby slaves over ESP-NOW.

This is separate from **Femto Miner**:

- **Femto Miner**: one device mines directly against the pool.
- **Distributed Miner**: one master coordinates one or more local slave devices.

## Architecture

The master:

- connects to WiFi using saved Femto OS WiFi profiles
- loads saved Femto Miner wallet and pool settings
- connects to the Stratum pool once
- broadcasts a pairing beacon when pairing is enabled
- assigns nonce ranges to paired slaves
- optionally mines locally
- submits valid shares found by itself or by slaves

The slaves:

- do not need WiFi credentials
- do not need wallet or pool settings
- channel-hop until they hear a master pairing beacon
- remember the paired master MAC and cluster ID
- receive compact work assignments
- hash assigned nonce ranges
- return hashrate, best difficulty, and found shares

## Protocol Summary

Distributed Miner uses ESP-NOW packets between the master and slaves. The packet flow is intentionally small:

- master beacon
- slave hello
- slave status
- work assignment
- work result
- cancel/reset signals

Assignments contain the block header, start nonce, and nonce count. Faster slaves report higher hashrate, and the master gives them larger work ranges to reduce ESP-NOW overhead.

Pairing uses the master's MAC address plus a persisted cluster ID. Resetting the cluster ID forces slaves to pair again.

## Supported Roles

### T-Display

Open **Distributed Miner**, choose **Master** or **Slave**, then start.

T-Display can act as:

- master
- slave
- master with local mining enabled
- master with local mining disabled

### ESP32-C3 OLED

Open **Distributed Miner**, tap to choose **Master** or **Slave**, then hold to start.

The C3 OLED UI is compact and mainly useful for testing or lightweight slave use.

### ESP32-C3 Headless

Flash the `FemtoOS-C3-Headless` build. It has a tiny LED/button launcher with Mouse Emulator and Slave Miner apps. Fresh boards start in the LED menu; open Slave Miner from the menu, or double-tap while Slave Miner is running to save it as the autolaunch app.

To clear a saved headless autolaunch app, return to the LED menu and double-tap. The menu becomes the boot default again.

See [../FemtoOS-C3-Headless/README.md](../FemtoOS-C3-Headless/README.md) for the headless-specific LED and BOOT behavior.

## Typical Setup

1. Flash the master with **Femto OS for T-Display** or **Femto OS for C3**.
2. Configure WiFi on the master through **WiFi Setup**.
3. Configure wallet and pool settings through **Femto Miner** setup if you do not want the defaults.
4. Flash slave boards with **Femto OS for C3 Headless**, or launch **Distributed Miner** in **Slave** mode on screened boards.
5. Launch **Distributed Miner** on the master in **Master** mode.
6. Start the cluster.
7. Open the pairing page and start **Pair Slaves**.
8. Wait for slaves to appear in the slave list.
9. Turn **Local Mining** on or off depending on whether the master should also hash.

## T-Display Master Controls

- **Dashboard**: Button 1 starts/stops the cluster. Button 2 changes page.
- **Pair Slaves**: Button 1 starts pairing.
- **Cluster Control**: Button 1 toggles local mining. Button 1 hold starts/stops the cluster.
- **Reset Cluster**: Button 1 resets the cluster ID. Slaves must pair again.
- Button 2 hold exits to the Femto OS menu.

## T-Display Slave Controls

- Button 2 changes status/detail pages.
- **Clear Pairing**: Button 1 hold forgets the saved master.
- **Exit Slave**: Button 1 hold exits to the Femto OS menu.
- Button 2 hold also exits to the menu.

## Headless C3 LED And Button

The headless C3 uses GPIO8 for status on tested ESP32-C3 SuperMini boards. The LED first shows which app is active, then shows that app's state pattern.

For Slave Miner:

- App marker: LED on, two short blinks, LED on again, short off gap.
- Solid LED for up to 5 seconds: actively or recently mining.
- Slow blink for up to 5 seconds: searching / not paired.
- Very slow blink for up to 5 seconds: paired but idle.
- Fast blink for up to 5 seconds: error.
- 2 taps: make Slave Miner the saved autolaunch app.
- 3 taps: clear saved master/cluster pairing.
- Hold BOOT for about five seconds: exit to the LED menu.
- In the LED menu, 2 taps clears the saved autolaunch app and keeps future boots in the menu.

The tested GPIO8 LED is active-low. Other boards may need LED polarity changes.

## Serial Debug

T-Display master serial runs at `115200` baud:

```text
cluster start
cluster stop
cluster stats
cluster pair
cluster reset
cluster local on
cluster local off
```

`cluster stats` prints total, local, and slave hashrate, slave count, jobs, submitted/accepted/rejected shares, channel, and last error.

Headless C3 serial also runs at `115200` baud and prints status every two seconds:

```text
[headless] build=<build> state=<state> paired=<yes/no> channel=<n> khps=<rate> jobs=<jobs> completed=<count> total_kh=<hashes>
```

## Clearing Saved Cluster Data

On Femto OS builds, use:

**Options / Save Manager / Cluster**

On headless C3, triple-tap while Slave Miner is running.

## Performance Notes

- T-Display/classic ESP32 slaves use the ESP32 hardware SHA path.
- ESP32-C3 slaves use the C3-compatible path and are much slower than T-Display/classic ESP32 boards.
- Local mining can be disabled on the master if you want the master to focus on coordinating slaves.
- Larger nonce assignments improve fast slave throughput by reducing ESP-NOW assignment overhead.

## Troubleshooting

- If a slave says it is paired but the master shows no slaves, reset cluster data on both devices and pair again.
- If the master is on channel `0`, start the cluster before pairing.
- If slaves show paired but `0H/s`, check that the master is connected to WiFi and the pool.
- If a headless C3 Slave Miner state pattern is blinking slowly forever, it is probably searching for a master beacon.
- If you change the master device, clear slave pairing before pairing with the new master.
